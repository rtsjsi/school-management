# Push to Git and DB

After making changes to this project (code, migrations, or config), **always**:

1. **Git**
   - Stage all changes: `git add -A` (or stage specific files if preferred).
   - Commit with a clear message describing what changed.
   - Push to the remote: `git push`.

2. **Database**
   - Run: `npm run db:push`
   - This applies any new Supabase migrations to the linked project (branch-specific).
   - If there are no new migrations, the command will report "Remote database is up to date."

Do both steps at the end of a task or session when you have made changes. Use PowerShell-compatible commands (e.g. `;` instead of `&&` for chaining if needed on Windows).
