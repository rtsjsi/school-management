# Deploy After Every Change

After making any changes to this project, always:

1. **Git**: Stage, commit, and push:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
   - `git push`

2. **Supabase**: If there are new or modified migrations in `supabase/migrations/`, run:
   - `npx supabase db push`

Do this as the final step of every task that modifies the codebase. Do not leave changes uncommitted or unpushed.
