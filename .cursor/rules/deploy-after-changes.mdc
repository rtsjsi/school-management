# Deploy After Changes

After making any code or schema changes to this project:

1. **Supabase**: Run `npx supabase db push` if migrations were added or modified.
2. **Git**: Stage, commit, and push all changes:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
   - `git push origin main`

Do not leave changes uncommitted or unpushed. Include this step as part of completing any task that modifies the codebase.
